Count the number of all entries (directories, files, links,...) in the directory, whose name is stored in the variable DIR (don't forget the hidden files). Write the following sentence In the directory XY, there are N entries to the terminal and at the same time to the file, whose name is stored in the variable FILE.

Note:

    In the listing, replace XY with the directory name and N with the number of entries.

    Pay attention to accents, numbers of spaces, etc.

Example:

In the variable DIR, there is the directory name examples, which contains 20 entries, and in the variable FILE, there is the filename test.txt. The sentence In the directory examples, there are 20 entries will be written to the terminal and also to the file test.txt.
