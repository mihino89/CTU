The directory name is stored in the variable DIR. There are more files in this directory, but only one file with the extension .txt. This file contains sentences that consist of words (a word can only contain lowercase and uppercase letters; all other characters are delimiters).

Write a script that prints seven-character word with the highest frequency to standard output. If there are more seven-character words with the highest frequency, then write the one closest to the end of the alphabet.

Example of the contents of a file with the extension .txt

Lorem znydjd maximus znydjd zotuifl bwxxqtb tellus znydjd zotuifl bwxxqtb
znydjd zotuifl bwxxqtb, porta znydjd zotuifl bwxxqtb znydjd zotuifl bwxxqtb.
Nullam znydjd velit znydjd zotuifl bwxxqtb znydjd zotuifl bwxxqtb
tortor znydjd zotuifl bwxxqtb tellus znydjd zotuifl bwxxqtb znydjd zotuifl.

In this case, your script should print zotuifl to standard output.
