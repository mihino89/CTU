The variable FILE contains the name of a text file that has exactly 30 lines. Each line consists of just one word, consisting of uppercase and lowercase letters and digits.

Modify this file so that all digits disappear from the words, all letters change to lowercase, and the modified words are sorted in ascending order. The modified file will be in the format of three tab-separated columns, with the first 10 words after sorting in the first column, the second 10 in the second column, and the rest in the third. Number the lines of the file.

Your commands must not leave a mess (ie undeleted temporary files)!

Example of input file (for 6 lines (2 + 2 + 2) instead of 30 (10 + 10 + 10), write the script for 30 according to the assignment):
