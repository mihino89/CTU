The www.barchart.com server contains a large amount of stock exchange information in the form of tables. The ability to download these tables in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format is a paid service. Because we do not have paid for this service, we copied the contents of the table to a text file from the website using the mouse. The name of this file is stored in the variable FILE and its content has the same structure as the files that are stored on the servers fray1.fit.cvut.cz and fray2.fit.cvut.cz in the directory /home/courses/BIPS1/public/DU/barchart with the suffix .txt.

Write a script that converts our file to CSV format and saves it to the file table.csv. The CSV file must have the same structure as the files in the /home/courses/BIPS1/public/DU/barchart directory with the suffix .csv.

You will get 2 points for solving this task.
